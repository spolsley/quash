quash - (qu)ite (a) (sh)ell
===

Quash is a very simple shell written in C.  In addition to the basic features of command execution and file system navigation, it has several more advanced features, including background job support, piping, I/O redirection, and environment variable access.  Unfortunately, it lacks a few conveniences like path completion and command history.

This was written as part of a class project, and while it is certainly usable, it is not intended to be a replacement for other, more mature shells.  Because it is not as powerful as many other shells, quash is better viewed as an investigation into how shells work.
